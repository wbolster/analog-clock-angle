Analog clock angle calculator
=============================

This program calculates the angle between the two hands of an analog clock for
any given time (with minute granularity).

Why?

Well, I sometimes use this problem in interviews. I would ask the candidate:
‘How would you implement a computer program to calculate the angle between the
two hands of an analog clock for a user-specified time, preferably using a
test-driven development approach?’

The goal is not to have candidates spell out a perfect solution, but just to see
what their strategy is when faced with a problem like this, how well they manage
to think aloud, if they ask follow-up questions (e.g. degrees or radians? which
time format?), testing approach (tests first? corner cases? boundary checking?),
whether they have some basic math skills, and so on.

In order to get some practical experience with this sample problem, I think I
should at least try to do it myself.

That's why. :)
